# Ostrich

Burrito Edition's ROM upload site no longer works with our systems, so I have created a newer version to subvert this restriction.

## To Do

- Rework Branch: rename and reorganize the website and repo
- Rework Branch: add landing page with shortcuts to various sections (pretty sure that's what index.html is supposed to be?)
- Rework Branch: add some sort of way to get discord working (probably won't do)
- Migration: gotta find some way to make this repo private (can't do at the moment)
